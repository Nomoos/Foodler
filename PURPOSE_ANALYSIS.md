- **Tezeo (Telmisartan)** - Angiotensin receptor blocker for blood pressure
- **Omeprazol** - Proton pump inhibitor for acid reflux

These indicate the user is managing cardiovascular health conditions, making the weight loss program medically important.

### Exercise Regimen
- **Morning:** 15 minutes low-intensity recumbent cycling
- **Evening:** 10 minutes low-intensity recumbent cycling
- **Total:** 25 minutes daily cardiovascular activity

The choice of recumbent exercise suggests consideration for joint health and cardiovascular safety given the user's current weight.

## Repository Objectives

Based on the content analysis, the Foodler repository aims to:

1. **Track and document** weight loss progress for family members
2. **Provide structured meal planning** following ketogenic/low-carb principles
3. **Monitor nutritional intake** with precise macro tracking
4. **Schedule supplementation** and medication adherence
5. **Coordinate exercise routines** suitable for overweight individuals
6. **Research dietary methodologies** (keto, mackerel diet)
7. **Support accountability** through documentation

## Nutritional Analysis

### Daily Totals (as planned)
- **Total Calories:** ~1,651 kcal (slightly under 2000 target)

## Medical Context

The presence of blood pressure medications and acid reflux treatment indicates this is not just a cosmetic weight loss program but a **medically necessary intervention** to improve overall health outcomes, particularly cardiovascular health.

## Future Development

The repository structure suggests plans for:
- Detailed implementation of researched diet plans
- Tracking mechanisms for the secondary user (female family member)
- Possible expansion to include recipes, shopping lists, and progress tracking
- Documentation of both keto and mackerel diet research findings

## Conclusion

The Foodler repository serves as a **comprehensive family health and weight management system** with a strong focus on structured dietary planning, medical compliance, and gradual lifestyle changes. The approach is medical-aware, scientifically structured, and designed for sustainable long-term health improvement rather than rapid weight loss.
